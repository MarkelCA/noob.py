# References

This is a test to check how references work with variable asigments / editing. 

## Conclusions
- For simple types if the value is the identic the memory address will be same for both. 
- For complex variables like dictionaries or lists the memory address is copied on equality, not changed on index editing, but the memory address is reasigned one the variable recieves a new value. 
- Also for complex variables it doesn't seem to asign the same memory addres when the value is the same.
